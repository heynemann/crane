Introduction
------------

crane is a build system that aims at being as simple as possible, yet provide a fluent language with which users can create their build scripts. 

Another goal for crane is to be easily extended. The reasoning behind that design decision is that people's build needs are REALLY different from project to project.

Name Origin
-----------

crane is named like that for two different reasons.

The first one is that cranes are building blocks in civil engineering. The analogy is crystal clear.

The second (and less known one) is that cranes are *awesome* birds, specially the Grey crowned crane (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_(bird) ).
