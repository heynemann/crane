* Include another crane file (include xxx.crn)

* Pyccuracy (run pyccuracy at /home/dev/tests with pt-br language ...)
* Nose (run tests at /home/dev/tests (with coverage))
* Code Analysis with sloccount (analyze code with sloccount at /home/dev/)
* Fabric integration (run Fabric script at xxx.fab)
