# Discussion
#    assert_raises() adds two optional arguments: "exc_args" 
#    and "exc_pattern". "exc_args" is a tuple that is expected 
#    to match the .args attribute of the raised exception. 
#    "exc_pattern" is a compiled regular expression that the 
#    stringified raised exception is expected to match.
